# Decomposition

When writing code, sometimes the problem is so big or complex that we don't know where to start, what to do, and in what order. We can use decomposition to solve this problem.

Decomposition is a useful problem-solving strategy that breaks down a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to  understand, and program. The decomposition unit in Java is the class.

For decomposition to work,

+ Subdivisions of the entire problem must be as independent as possible.
+ A function should solve a problem.
+ Function parameters should contain only what is necessary.
+ It should be easy to explain what the function accomplishes.

## Advantages

+ The code of a complex program can run on many lines of code. If a mistake is made, it takes a long time to find it. Decomposition speeds up fault finding and saves time.
+ It allows programmers to easily copy and reuse useful pieces of code for other programs.
+ Segregated subtasks can be performed or solved by different individuals or teams at the same time.
+ Understanding and solving a small problem is easier than solving a complex big problem.
+ It may be possible to process modules in parallel, resulting in faster processing of the issue as a whole.
+ When the problem is divided into sub-tasks, each sub-task can be examined in detail.
+ Maintenance is easier.

## Disadvantages

+ Poorly understood problems are difficult to decompose.
+ If parts of a problem are worked on in parallel, it may be difficult or impossible to eventually recombine them into a single solution and solve the original problem.
